# Practice Repository - Java Branch

This branch of the **Practice** repository is dedicated to code and projects related to Java programming. Here, I practice concepts, assignments, and projects from my university courses that involve Java.

## About

The Java branch contains:

- **Core Java Concepts**: OOP principles, exception handling, collections framework.
- **University Assignments**: Programs and problem sets assigned during coursework.
- **Mini Projects**: Small Java applications and experiments.
- **Algorithms**: Implementations of common algorithms in Java.

## Structure

The branch is organized into folders based on topics or projects. Each folder may include:

- Source code files (`.java`).
- Supporting files like documentation or resources.
- A `README.md` file with specific details about the folder.

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository and switch to the `java` branch:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/tareque-ridawi/practice.git
   cd practice
   git checkout java
   ```

2. Navigate through the folders to explore the code.

3. Compile and run the Java files using the following commands:

   ```bash
   javac FileName.java
   java FileName
   ```

4. Modify and experiment with the code to deepen your understanding.
